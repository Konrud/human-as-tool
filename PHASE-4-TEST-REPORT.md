## Recommendations for Backend Integration

When backend is ready:

1. **Replace Mock State**: Remove mock channel status in ChatPage
2. **Connect WebSocket Events**: Wire up actual channel\_\* events from backend
3. **Persist Preferences**: Save channel preferences to backend
4. **Real-time Status**: Implement actual channel health monitoring
5. **Retry Logic**: Connect retry buttons to backend reconnection
6. **Fallback Triggers**: Backend should send channel_fallback events

---

## Test Environment

- **OS**: Windows 10
- **Node.js**: Current stable version
- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Build Tool**: Vite 7.1.9
- **TypeScript**: Latest stable
- **React**: 18+
- **Test Date**: October 14, 2025
