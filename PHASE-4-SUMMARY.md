## Technical Implementation

### State Management

```typescript
// useChannel hook manages:
- Channel status for all three channels
- Fallback information and history
- Reconnection attempts tracking
- Channel priority order
- Retry limits and timeouts
```

### Event Handling

```typescript
// useSession hook handles:
-channel_status_update -
  channel_fallback -
  channel_reconnect_attempt -
  channel_reconnect_success -
  channel_reconnect_failed -
  change_preferred_channel(action);
```

### UI Components
