# Feature Specification: Interactive Agent Chat System with Human Feedback Integration

**Feature Branch**: `001-interactive-agent-chat`  
**Created**: 2025-10-11  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Chat Single Page Application for communicating with an agent that can pause, contact humans for feedback or approval (via chat or by sending them emails or slack messages), and resume execution based on human responses."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-10-11

- Q: Maximum number of concurrent sessions per user? → A: Three sessions per user
- Q: Feedback timeout duration and fallback behavior? → A: 48 hours timeout with requester notification
- Q: How to handle multiple responses to same request? → A: All responses logged, first valid wins
- Q: Authentication mechanism required? → A: OAuth2 with JWT tokens
- Q: Channel failover priority order? → A: Chat → Email → Slack
- Q: Rate limiting threshold? → A: 30 requests per minute per user
- Q: How to handle all channels failure? → A: Queue messages and retry with exponential backoff (starting at 1s, max 1 hour, max 10 attempts)
- Q: What happens when chat reopens during alternative channel communication? → A: Chat takes immediate precedence, system syncs conversation state from alternative channels
- Q: How to handle in-progress operations during channel switch? → A: Complete current operation on original channel, new operations use new channel

## User Scenarios & Testing

### User Story 1 - Real-Time Agent Chat Communication (Priority: P1)

Users can engage in real-time chat conversations with an AI agent, seeing responses as they are generated (streaming) and clear status indicators for agent states.

**Why this priority**: Core functionality that enables basic interaction between users and the agent.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by initiating a chat conversation and verifying streaming responses and status indicators.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user opens the chat interface, **When** they send a message, **Then** they see the agent's response streaming in real-time
2. **Given** the agent is processing a request, **When** it needs time to think, **Then** a clear "thinking" indicator is displayed
3. **Given** the agent is responding, **When** the response is streaming, **Then** text appears progressively in a typing-like animation

### User Story 2 - Agent Pause and Resume Workflow (Priority: P1)

Agent can pause execution to await human feedback and clearly communicate its paused state to users.

**Why this priority**: Essential for handling scenarios requiring human intervention.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering a scenario requiring approval and verifying the pause/resume flow.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the agent needs approval, **When** it pauses execution, **Then** the chat shows a clear "Awaiting Approval" status
2. **Given** the agent is paused, **When** human approval is received, **Then** the agent resumes execution and updates chat status

---

### User Story 3 - Multi-Channel Human Feedback (Priority: P2)

Agent can request human feedback through multiple channels (chat, email, Slack) and handle responses appropriately.

**Why this priority**: Enables flexible communication options but not critical for basic functionality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by triggering feedback requests through each channel independently.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** approval is needed, **When** the agent sends an email request, **Then** the recipient can approve/deny via email
2. **Given** feedback is required, **When** the agent sends a Slack message, **Then** the recipient can respond through Slack
3. **Given** multiple channels are used, **When** a response is received on any channel, **Then** the agent processes it appropriately

---

### User Story 4 - Communication Channel Preference (Priority: P1)

Users can specify their preferred communication channel for agent responses after each request.

**Why this priority**: Essential for providing a flexible and user-friendly communication experience.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by verifying channel selection and response delivery through chosen channels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user sends a request, **When** they make the request, **Then** they are presented with channel options (chat, email, Slack)
2. **Given** a user selects email as their preferred channel, **When** the agent has a response, **Then** the response is sent via email
3. **Given** a user selects Slack as their preferred channel, **When** the agent has a response, **Then** the response is sent via Slack

---

### User Story 5 - Seamless Channel Fallback (Priority: P2)

System maintains communication when users close the chat by falling back to alternative channels.

**Why this priority**: Ensures continuous communication even when the primary channel is unavailable.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by closing the chat mid-conversation and verifying continued communication through alternative channels.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has an active chat session, **When** they close the browser/tab, **Then** the system detects the disconnection
2. **Given** the chat is disconnected, **When** the agent has a response, **Then** the system attempts to reach the user through email and Slack
3. **Given** multiple channels are available, **When** the primary channel fails, **Then** the system tries alternative channels in a predefined order

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when human feedback times out?
- How does system handle multiple responses to the same feedback request?
- What happens during network disconnections mid-conversation?
- How does system handle concurrent chat sessions with the same agent?
- What happens if email/Slack services are unavailable?
- What happens if all communication channels fail?
- How does system handle channel preference changes mid-conversation?
- What if a user reopens the chat while being communicated through alternative channels?

## Requirements
