- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

The following clarifications are needed before proceeding to `/speckit.plan`:

## Question 1: Concurrent Sessions

**Context**: FR-008: "System MUST handle concurrent chat sessions"

**What we need to know**: What is the maximum number of concurrent sessions per user?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer                  | Implications                                                               |
| ------ | ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| A      | Single session per user | Simplest to implement, may limit user flexibility                          |
| B      | 3 sessions per user     | Balanced approach, allows multi-tasking while maintaining system stability |
| C      | Unlimited sessions      | Maximum flexibility but may impact system performance                      |
| Custom | Provide your own limit  | Specify a different number based on requirements                           |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_

## Question 2: Feedback Timeout

**Context**: FR-009: "System MUST implement feedback timeout handling"

**What we need to know**: What should be the timeout duration and fallback behavior?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer                             | Implications                           |
| ------ | ---------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| A      | 24 hours timeout, auto-cancel      | Conservative approach, clear closure   |
| B      | 48 hours timeout, notify requester | Balanced approach with notification    |
| C      | 7 days timeout, escalate to admin  | Maximum wait time with escalation path |
| Custom | Custom duration and behavior       | Specify your own timeout rules         |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_

## Question 3: Multiple Responses

**Context**: FR-010: "System MUST ensure feedback response uniqueness"

**What we need to know**: How should the system handle multiple responses to the same feedback request?

**Suggested Answers**:

| Option | Answer                                 | Implications                                  |
| ------ | -------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| A      | First response wins                    | Simple but may miss important later responses |
| B      | Last response within timeout wins      | More complex but allows correction            |
| C      | All responses logged, first valid wins | Complete audit trail with clear resolution    |
| Custom | Custom handling logic                  | Specify your own response handling rules      |

**Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
