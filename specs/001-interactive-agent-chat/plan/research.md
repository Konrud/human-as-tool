# Research Tasks

## 1. WebSocket Implementation Research

### FastAPI WebSocket Integration

- **Decision**: Use FastAPI's built-in WebSocket support with connection manager pattern
- **Rationale**:
  - Native integration with FastAPI
  - High performance and low overhead
  - Built-in connection lifecycle management
  - Good support for authentication middleware
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Socket.IO: Rejected due to additional overhead and complexity
  - Raw WebSockets: Rejected due to lack of built-in management features
  - gRPC: Rejected as overkill for this use case

### React WebSocket Integration

- **Decision**: Custom WebSocket hook with TanStack Query integration
- **Rationale**:
  - Seamless integration with React's component lifecycle
  - Built-in reconnection and error handling
  - Efficient state management with TanStack Query
  - Type-safe event handling
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Socket.IO-client: Rejected to match backend decision
  - react-use-websocket: Rejected for better control and TanStack Query integration

## 2. Channel Integration Research

### Gmail API Integration

- **Decision**: Use Gmail API with OAuth2 and application-specific credentials
- **Rationale**:
  - Official Google API support
  - Strong security model
  - Good documentation and SDK support
  - Support for both sending and receiving emails
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - SMTP/IMAP: Rejected due to limited features and security
  - Third-party email services: Rejected for direct Google integration

### Slack API Integration

- **Decision**: Use Slack Bolt SDK with Bot tokens
- **Rationale**:
  - Official Slack SDK
  - Built-in support for events and interactions
  - Simplified authentication handling
  - Good support for real-time messaging
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Raw Slack Web API: Rejected due to complexity
  - Slack RTM API: Rejected as it's being deprecated

## 3. State Management Research

### TanStack Query Configuration

- **Decision**: Use TanStack Query with WebSocket integration
- **Rationale**:
  - Built-in cache management
  - Optimistic updates for better UX
  - Real-time data synchronization
  - Efficient invalidation patterns
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Redux: Rejected due to boilerplate and complexity
  - Zustand: Rejected for TanStack Query's built-in capabilities
  - MobX: Rejected for simpler solution

### Cross-Channel State Sync

- **Decision**: Event-driven architecture with central state manager
- **Rationale**:
  - Consistent state across channels
  - Efficient updates and synchronization
  - Clear event flow and debugging
  - Scalable architecture
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Polling: Rejected for performance reasons
  - Shared database: Rejected for latency concerns

## 4. Authentication Flow Research

### OAuth2 Implementation

- **Decision**: FastAPI's built-in OAuth2 with JWT
- **Rationale**:
  - Native FastAPI security
  - Standard OAuth2 flow
  - Easy integration with frontend
  - Built-in middleware support
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Custom auth: Rejected for security best practices
  - Session-based: Rejected for scalability

### Token Management

- **Decision**: Short-lived JWTs with refresh tokens
- **Rationale**:
  - Standard security practice
  - Balance between security and UX
  - Easy integration with multiple channels
  - Built-in expiration handling
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Long-lived tokens: Rejected for security
  - Session tokens: Rejected for scalability

## 5. BAML Integration Research

### BAML Setup

- **Decision**: Use BAML with custom prompt templates
- **Rationale**:
  - Strong typing support
  - Version control for prompts
  - Easy testing and validation
  - Good documentation
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Raw prompt strings: Rejected for maintainability
  - LangChain: Rejected for simpler BAML solution

### Agent State Management

- **Decision**: BAML state management with custom wrapper
- **Rationale**:
  - Type-safe state management
  - Easy integration with FastAPI
  - Clear state transitions
  - Good testing support
- **Alternatives Considered**:
  - Custom state machine: Rejected for built-in capabilities
  - Redis state: Rejected for added complexity
