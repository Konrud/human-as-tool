# Human-as-Tool Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Single Page Application

All user-facing functionality must be delivered as a single page application (SPA).

### II. Responsive Design

The application must be fully responsive, providing an optimal experience across devices and screen sizes. Mobile-first design approach is mandatory. Fluids layouts that adapt to all screen sizes. Touch-friendly interfaces with appropriate sizing.

### III. Minimal Dependencies

Dependencies should be minimized. Only include external libraries when strictly required for functionality or security. Regular dependencies audit and removal of unused packages.

### IV. Justified Complexity

Any added complexity must be justified by clear functional, performance, or maintainability benefits. Simplicity is preferred.

### VI. Performance first

Fast loading times across all devices and connections; Optimized assets (images, fonts, scripts); Lazy loading for non-critical content; Core Web Vitals compliance.

### VII. Accessibility & Standards

WCAG 2.1 AA compliance; Semantic HTML structure; Progressive enhancements principals; Cross-browser compatibility principles.

## Technical Standards

1. All code must follow established coding standards and best practices
2. Performance metrics must be defined and monitored
3. Security requirements must be documented and implemented
4. Accessibility standards (WCAG) must be met

## Development Process

1. All changes must be reviewed and approved through pull requests
2. Documentation must be updated with code changes
3. Regular code quality audits must be performed

## Build & Deployment Standards
1. Environment specific builds supported (dev/staging/prod).
